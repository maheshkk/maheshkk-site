Most software today expects users to translate goals into steps.

Agentic systems invert that pattern. The user sets intent, and software proposes and executes a plan with checkpoints.

To build for this era, product teams need three shifts:

- Design for supervision, not just direct control.
- Make system reasoning legible to users.
- Build trust controls into the first release.

Agents will not replace people. They will raise the baseline of what individuals can produce.
