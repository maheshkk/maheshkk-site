AI is arriving in classrooms, offices, and phones faster than any technology wave I have seen.

Access will be widespread. The real difference will be **adaptation**: how quickly you learn to use AI to think, build, and create.

If you are a student, do not treat AI like a shortcut. Treat it like a lab partner.

Try this:

- Ask it to explain an idea three different ways.
- Ask it to critique your work.
- Ask it to help you design a small project.
- Build something tiny, then iterate.

You are holding a magic ball.

What will you do with it?
