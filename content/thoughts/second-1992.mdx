In 1992, I wrote a tiny BASIC program that made a ball bounce on a school computer screen.

The code was basic, but the feeling was profound: software could turn imagination into interaction.

AI brings back that same emotional spark. But this time, the entry barrier is lower and the creative surface is wider.

The people who benefit most will not be the people with the best tools.
They will be the people with the strongest learning rhythm.

Build, reflect, adjust, repeat.
